  This project introduces a dataset designed for fine-tuning
  NLP models to improve semantic relation extraction between
  entities, addressing the need for both high accuracy and
  operational efficiency in NLP applications. By focusing on
  reducing computational costs and enhancing processing
  speed, the dataset aims to support the development of more
  cost-effective and agile NLP models. This contribution
  offers a valuable resource for advancing NLP technologies
  in efficiently understanding complex textual relationships
  while optimizing resource use.
