      "  The impact of a random phase diffuser on laser light fluctuations (scintillations) is investigated. Both temporal and spatial phase variations introduced by the phase diffuser are analyzed. It is shown that for large amplitude phase fluctuations, a finite-time effect decreases the ability of the phase diffuser to suppress scintillations. The explicit dependence of the scintillation index on finite-time phase variations is obtained for long propagation paths.\n",
